# Bed-Shaker-Swe415

## Information:

Capstone project that makes notifying the deaf community easier. This android app lives on a deaf persons phone and will be connected to a Shelly smart switch. When a person SMS messages the user with a specific keyword it will trigger the smart switch which would be connected to a light or maybe a bed shaker for example. The user is able to sepcify who they want to be able to trigger the switch in the app, while also being able to specify keyword will trigger the switch. The app also consists of a setup page that the user will go through to connect the smart switch to their wifi (This process is very similar to how you would do it with a google home pod for example). Lastly, all of this is done in the background so the user doesn't have to open the app at all for this to work.

Please look at the file, 415_BEDSHAKER_POSTER.pptx.pdf for more information releating to the project.
