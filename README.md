# Bed-Shaker-Swe415

## Information:

Capstone project that makes notifying the deaf community easier. This app lives on a deaf persons phone and will be connected to a Shelly smart switch. When a person SMS messages the user with a specific keyword it will trigger the smart switch which would be connected to a light or maybe a bed shaker for example. Worked with 4 other students over the course of one semester. Please look at the file, 415_BEDSHAKER_POSTER.pptx.pdf for all information releating to the project
